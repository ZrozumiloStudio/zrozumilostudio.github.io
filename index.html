  <h2 style="color:#42ff42";>Lore</h2>
  <p style="color:#abffab";>The accident at the Yellow Mountain plant released a lot of harmful substances into the air. There was a farm next to the plant where all the animals started going crazy and mutating, and all the farmers died long ago. Local residents and authorities do not know about the situation at the farm, and those who went there to investigate have disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <h1 style="color:#ffe342";>ChickenFine:Yellow Mountain</h1>
  <p style="color:#ffeb78";>Free DLC for the original ChickenFine, now XP is replaced by "Zelenolit" ore and the action takes place at the "Yellow Mountain" plant, where there is a lot of radiation and because of this the game is very hardcore. The player has only 30 HP and a very weak revolver, bonuses like a bomb that increases XP were removed and the RPA suit was strengthened, The DLC also has incredible original music and wonderful ambient!</p>
