  <h2 style="color:#42ff42";>Lore</h2>
  <p style="color:#abffab";>The accident at the Yellow Mountain plant released a lot of harmful substances into the air. There was a farm next to the plant where all the animals started going crazy and mutating, and all the farmers died long ago. Local residents and authorities do not know about the situation at the farm, and those who went there to investigate have disappeared without a trace.</p>
